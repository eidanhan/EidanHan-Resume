        </h1>Business
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an ambitious, dedicated student pursuing an education in business administration at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). My involvement in Gamma Phi Beta has enhanced my desire to follow a business administration career because of the leadership opportunities that I have obtained. I am currently the Personal and Chapter Enrichment (PACE) chairwoman, where I give either a 5 minute or 20 minute presentation on topics such as mental health, life hacks, and motivational tips once a week at chapter meetings. The idea behind this position is to focus on the betterment of sisters in chapter, and I am encouraged to utilize my creative side to create unique and practical presentations. The position has given me an opportunity to express my voice in my sorority while also equipping me with public speaking skills that will be beneficial in the future. 
        
        I also have experience with public speaking and leadership through my roles as president, communications director, and activities coordinator of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) at the high school level. As president I supervised the activity of board members, helping assign tasks to certain people and monitoring their process. As communications director, my responsibility was to send emails to all members of the club and to keep members updated by posting on platforms of social media like Instagram, Facebook, and Slack. Lastly, as activities coordinator, I was able to plan events such as study sessions and I frequently kept in contact with our club advisor to ensure that the club was on the right track in terms of planning for future events and fulfilling the club standards.
        
        Along with my involvement in FBLA, I was a member of the Associated Student Body (ASB) on campus. As a senior member, I was in charge of helping to plan assemblies and rallies to boost school spirit and prepare for big events such as Homecoming, Prom, Kindness Week, etc. I was able to express my creativity, voice my opinions, and represent the senior class. During sports seasons such as football and basketball, ASB encourages students to come support the athletes and ASB was featured on the Orange County Newspaper as having one of the most spirited crowds in the stands. During my time on ASB, I attended several leadership conferences which taught me what it means to be a leader and how I can be the most effective leader that promotes positive change and improvement within the school. Also, by working on a team, I was able to understand the importance of teamwork and was encouraged to communicate with all members of ASB in order to reach goals and be positive examples to the student body. I have also chosen to give back to my community by being a volunteer at my church. On one Sunday of every month for a year, I read the Scripture to a 100-person congregation, and on the Sundays where I did not publically speak, I helped distribute baskets to collect money during mass and I also brought the Eucharist to the priest during service. Therefore, with my leadership and volunteer experience, I have gained immense amounts of knowledge of where I want to focus my career in the future. My participation in the organizations of my choice have shaped me into who I am today and have sparked my passion for business, marketing, and administration.
